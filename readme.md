RayAlloc - WIP
===

__RayAlloc__ is a 2-in-1 library that provides a heap allocator and a dynamic array library. Combining the 2 into a single implementation allows for better memory management with less overall bookkeeping.

Current version is `0.0.1-dev`.  
More detailed documentation will become available when the library is more complete.
