TODO:

## For the next commit
- fix bugs in everything
- write a simple [_quick.c] to make sure no compilation errors
- increment [version.txt]
## For after that
- write docs before I forget
- write tests and fix bugs
- implement array and map resizing
- update the API section in README
- write more docs
- have actual synchronization for `sh_map`
## Keep in mind
- lnfree is redundant on ar_f -> simplify code
- remove f1 check in coalesce_fwd
